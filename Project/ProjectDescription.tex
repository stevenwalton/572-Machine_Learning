\section{Project Description}
We attempt to prototype streamline generation by use of UNets. 
We choose to use a UNet because it is a simple way to encode information. 
It is not expected to generate an efficient model as this task is extremely
difficult. They hypothesis was that we might be able to train a network to 
identify key segments and segment out key regions. Ultimately this failed and
we learned that image segmentation comes nowhere close to providing a 
reasonable model for streamlines.
